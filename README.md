# weather-web-app
A web app for the weather. Built with ReactJS and the OpenWeatherMap API.

This web app is a variation of [Tyler McGinnis's React.js Fundamentals Curriculum](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/react-fundamentals-curriculum). 
All code is my own.

To run:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/justinsingh/weather-web-app.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
